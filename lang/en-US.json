Enterprises are no longer choosing between public and private clouds; they are embracing **hybrid architectures**.\r\n\r\n## Why Hybrid?\r\n\r\n1.  **Security**: Keep sensitive data on-premise.\r\n2.  **Scalability**: Burst into the public cloud when traffic spikes.\r\n3.  **Cost**: Optimize workloads based on price/performance.\r\n\r\nAt Assuvar, we believe the future lies in seamless orchestration between these environments."
