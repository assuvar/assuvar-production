# The Future is Hybrid

Cloud computing has evolved rapidly over the last decade. Enterprises are no longer choosing between public and private clouds; they are embracing **hybrid architectures**.

## Why Hybrid?

1.  **Security**: Keep sensitive data on-premise.
2.  **Scalability**: Burst into the public cloud when traffic spikes.
3.  **Cost**: Optimize workloads based on price/performance.

At Structura IT, we believe the future lies in seamless orchestration between these environments.
